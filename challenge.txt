The XZ backdoor refers to a security vulnerability found in certain versions of the xz-utils package, specifically versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. This backdoor was designed to manipulate the SSH server (sshd) by compromising its authentication process. It allowed attackers to gain control over SSH connections, potentially enabling them to steal files, install malware, or perform other malicious actions on affected systems. However, the backdoor was discovered before these malicious versions were widely deployed in production environments, minimizing its real-world impact. The issue is tracked as CVE-2024-3094, and users are advised to update their installations to avoid this vulnerability.
